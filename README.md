# MiniProject
This project report presents a methodology for stance detection using a graph based approach combined with machine learning techniques. The methodology 
involves generating a graph structure from the dataset, applying the deep walk 
algorithm for node embeddings, and utilizing a classifier such as logistic regression or 
SVM for node classification. The node embeddings are trained on the stance 
attributes, particularly the title, and can accurately predict the stance of unseen nodes. 
The proposed methodology enhances stance detection by capturing relationships 
between textual instances and incorporating contextual information. The results 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology in accurately classifying stance 
categories.
